# SDKWork Standards Alignment

Application: `sdkwork-web-server`

Updated: 2026-07-31

This document records current implementation and evidence. It does not declare production release
approval. Normative requirements are owned by `../sdkwork-specs`.

## Framework And Capability Matrix

| Capability | Current state | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sdkwork-web-framework` | Integrated | App/backend route manifests, `WebRequestContext`, IAM resolver, framework `service_router`, health/readiness/metrics |
| `sdkwork-database` | Integrated | PostgreSQL-only authoritative manifest/baseline, lifecycle host, one process-shared typed pool, repository parity and recovery tests |
| `sdkwork-utils-rust` | Integrated | API envelopes, pagination, crypto, SHA-256, validation, serde helpers, platform helpers |
| `sdkwork-id-core` | Integrated through database ID support | Snowflake internal IDs and UUID resource identities |
| Backend SDK | Integrated | Generated TypeScript/Rust family, AgentToken auth, bounded response reads, Node Daemon consumption without handwritten HTTP |
| `sdkwork-drive` | Gated, no current upload capability | No business upload/presign/provider ownership; contract test rejects future bypasses |
| `sdkwork-discovery` | Gated, no current RPC transport | No tonic/prost service; contract test requires RPC framework and discovery together if RPC is introduced |

## Architecture State

- OpenAPI YAML is authored under `apis/`; materialized JSON, route manifests, and generated SDK
  inputs are deterministic derivatives.
- App and backend operations use the SDKWork v3 success envelopes and Problem Details error shape.
- The standalone gateway composes framework management routes with the bounded HTTP/HTTPS data
  plane. Management routes call services through ports; SQLx stays in repository modules.
- Database bootstrap returns one SDKWork lifecycle-owned PostgreSQL pool; production source
  contains no alternative-engine repository, `AnyPool` bridge, or second pool.
- Agent sync byte-count projections use engine-specific SQL and cast PostgreSQL `OCTET_LENGTH`
  results to `BIGINT`, matching the shared Rust `i64` repository contract.
- The Web Node Daemon uses the application-root generated Rust backend SDK for heartbeat and sync,
  with typed AgentToken configuration, canonical envelope decoding, and finite response limits.
- Proxy orchestration, upstream selection/health, request-body controls, metrics, TLS, DNS, admission,
  and protocol guards are separated into focused private modules.
- TLS certificate and private-key parsing uses the maintained
  `rustls-pki-types::pem::PemObject` surface; the unmaintained `rustls-pemfile` dependency is not
  present.
- IAM provider callbacks consume `quick-xml` 0.41+, preserve XML entity and CDATA values, and
  reject DTDs, nested callback fields, unknown entities, and incomplete documents.

## API And SDK Guarantees

- Authored Agent routes explicitly declare `x-sdkwork-route-auth: agent-token` and require the
  `AgentToken` security scheme.
- Generated SDK methods return domain payloads after SDKWork v3 envelope unwrapping and reject
  nonzero business codes.
- Backend SDK generation defaults to TypeScript and Rust, retains generator control-plane manifests,
  removes stale owned files, and is idempotent on an unchanged contract.
- `sdk-manifest.json` and `specs/component.spec.json` agree on IAM SDK dependencies.
- Generated files under `generated/server-openapi` are generator-owned and are never hand-edited.

## Deployment And Release State

`standalone.production` is a host-package profile. `cloud.production` is a Kubernetes/container-image
profile with digest-bound templates, a bounded migration Job, StatefulSet identity, probes,
PodDisruptionBudget, non-root execution, read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, and
secret-manager references.

The four Linux server package declarations in `sdkwork.app.config.json` are disabled and carry
`releaseBuildDeferred: true`. Archive packaging, checksum, Sigstore, CycloneDX, x64/arm64 smoke,
database recovery, and HA workflow steps are implemented, but no container registry publication
authority or production release approval is declared. Docker/Kubernetes files are deployment
templates, not evidence that an image has been published or deployed.

## Verification

Primary local gates:

```powershell
pnpm check
pnpm verify
pnpm db:validate
pnpm topology:validate
pnpm test:postgres:required
pnpm test:database:recovery
pnpm test:postgres:ha
node ..\sdkwork-specs\tools\deployctl.mjs validate --root . --profile cloud.production
node ..\sdkwork-specs\tools\deployctl.mjs validate --root . --profile standalone.production
node ..\sdkwork-github-workflow\scripts\sdkwork-workflow.mjs validate --config sdkwork.workflow.json
```

On 2026-07-21, a local Docker 28.0.4 Linux daemon completed the pinned PostgreSQL lifecycle/seed/drift
test, PostgreSQL repository parity test, checksummed PostgreSQL custom-format backup/restore,
streaming replication, primary shutdown,
standby promotion, and post-promotion tenant write. Linux x64/arm64 archive smoke, registry
publication, image signing, Kubernetes rollout, and production observability still require their
declared Linux runners, credentials, infrastructure, and release approval.

Supply-chain verification covers the Web Server application lock and its source Core/UI workspaces;
all three currently report no known Node vulnerabilities. The shared frontend toolchain uses Vite
8.1.5 with esbuild 0.28.1, while VitePress remains scoped to its compatible Vite 6.4.3 line. RustSec
reports only `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` for `rsa` 0.9.10, which has no fixed release. Current consumers use
RSA key generation, signing, and verification, not the advisory's PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption path. The
advisory is intentionally not hidden by an audit ignore; accepting an exception or replacing the
shared IAM/framework crypto implementation requires human security review.
