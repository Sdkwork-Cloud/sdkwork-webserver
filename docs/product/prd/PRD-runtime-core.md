# SDKWork Web Server Runtime Core PRD

Status: active
Owner: SDKWork maintainers
Application: sdkwork-web
Updated: 2026-07-16
Parent: [PRD.md](PRD.md)
Specs: NGINX_SPEC.md, SECURITY_SPEC.md, PERFORMANCE_SPEC.md, CONFIG_SPEC.md, TEST_SPEC.md

## 1. Purpose

Define the minimum runtime behavior required for SDKWork Web Server to operate as a complete, modern HTTP Web Server rather than only a management API, configuration renderer, or Nginx controller.

The complete runtime is a Rust data plane that can boot from a verified local snapshot, bind real HTTP/HTTPS listeners, route requests, serve static content, reverse proxy upstreams, enforce policy, remain bounded under hostile load, reload without corrupting active traffic, and continue serving the last verified configuration during control-plane or database outages.

## 2. Definition Of A Complete V1 HTTP Web Server

V1 is complete only when one packaged runtime can perform all P0 capabilities without requiring an external Nginx process:

| Capability | V1 level | Completion condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP/1.0 compatibility and HTTP/1.1 | P0 | Strict parsing, framing, keep-alive, pipelining-safe response order, streaming, timeouts, and conformance tests. |
| HTTP/2 | P0 | TLS ALPN, bounded HPACK and streams, flow control, GOAWAY drain, abuse defenses, and conformance tests. |
| HTTPS | P0 | TLS 1.2/1.3, SNI, valid certificate selection, atomic rotation, and served-handshake proof. |
| Virtual hosts and routes | P0 | Deterministic Nginx-profile server and location selection. |
| Static Web content | P0 | Safe files, indexes, SPA fallback, conditional requests, ranges, MIME, compression variants, and cache policy. |
| Reverse proxy | P0 | Streaming HTTP upstreams, WebSocket, SSE, DNS, pools, deadlines, retries, health-aware balancing, and upstream TLS. |
| Runtime lifecycle | P0 | Validate, start, readiness, reload, drain, stop, status, local recovery, and service/container integration. |
| Resource governance | P0 | Hierarchical bounded memory, connections, descriptors, queues, buffers, disk, CPU-expensive work, and overload shedding. |
| Operations | P0 | Structured logs, metrics, trace correlation, health/readiness, audit for changes, and support diagnostics. |
| Proxy cache and compression | P1 release gate | Correct eligibility, bounded storage, revalidation, stampede defense, poisoning defense, gzip/Brotli, and purge authorization. |
| gRPC reverse proxy | P1 | HTTP/2 request/response streaming, trailers, deadlines, cancellation, and health-aware upstream behavior. |
| HTTP/3, generic TCP/UDP, WASM/WAF | Future | Separate requirements, threat models, architecture decisions, and release gates. |

A runtime that only exposes app-api/backend-api, writes Nginx files, changes database status, or starts an Axum management listener does not satisfy this definition.

## 3. Runtime Plane Boundaries

The product has three explicit planes:

| Plane | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Request data plane | Accept, TLS, HTTP parsing, routing, static files, proxying, policies, local metrics, and active immutable snapshot. | Synchronous database/control-plane calls required for every request. |
| Configuration and control plane | Authoring, validation orchestration, revisions, deployment, certificate lifecycle, node assignment, audit, and management APIs. | Mutable request-path routing state that bypasses snapshot activation. |
| Host operations plane | Process config, physical sockets, service account, runtime paths, resource ceilings, admin exposure, supervisor/orchestrator integration, and local recovery. | App-owned domains, routes, content, or tenant secrets outside node assignments. |

An application declares logical traffic intent. Host policy determines physical exposure and global ceilings. The compiler produces a canonical, signed, checksummed, immutable node snapshot. The data plane reads the snapshot through typed in-process structures and never executes authored JSON, Nginx text, database rows, or template expressions on the request hot path.

## 4. Bootstrap And Local Recovery

Startup stages are deterministic:

1. Resolve typed host runtime configuration and canonical runtime directories.
2. Validate service account, file ownership, secret providers, clocks, descriptors, memory ceilings, and required platform capabilities.
3. Load the requested immutable snapshot or the last verified local snapshot according to startup policy.
4. Verify schema version, signature, checksum, host assignment, resource references, certificate material, and compatibility profile.
5. Compile or map request-path indexes away from listener threads.
6. Bind and configure physical sockets without exposing traffic.
7. Build TLS, routing, upstream, cache, policy, logging, and metrics state completely.
8. Start accepts, prove listener behavior through local probes, and only then become ready.

Production must not silently start with a generated default site, self-signed certificate, empty route table, permissive proxy, or incomplete snapshot. If no acceptable snapshot is available, affected public listeners remain closed and diagnostics identify the exact blocker.

The last verified snapshot and assigned encrypted resources are retained locally within a bounded rollback policy. A temporary control-plane, PostgreSQL, Redis, ACME, or DNS control API outage must not interrupt already active configuration.

## 5. HTTP/1.x Protocol Correctness

The runtime supports HTTP/1.0 compatibility and HTTP/1.1 with strict, incremental parsing:

- Request line, method token, request-target form, version, header names, header values, and line endings are validated before routing.
- Origin-form is the default for origin service. Absolute-form is accepted only under an explicit reverse-proxy compatibility policy. Authority-form/`CONNECT` is rejected unless a future reviewed tunnel capability enables it.
- `Host` is required and validated for HTTP/1.1. Duplicate or conflicting host authority is rejected.
- Conflicting `Content-Length`, invalid duplicate length, ambiguous `Transfer-Encoding`, `Transfer-Encoding` plus `Content-Length`, obsolete line folding, control characters, whitespace ambiguity, and malformed chunking fail closed to prevent request smuggling.
- Chunked bodies, trailers, `Expect: 100-continue`, keep-alive, close semantics, and HTTP/1.0 connection compatibility follow declared protocol behavior.
- Pipelined requests, when accepted, preserve response order and cannot create unbounded queued responses. The server may stop reading or reject additional pipeline depth at its configured bound.
- Method handling preserves registered and extension method tokens for proxy routes while static/managed routes return deterministic `405` and `Allow` behavior where applicable.
- `HEAD`, informational responses, `204`, `304`, and responses to `CONNECT` obey no-body and framing rules.

Parser limits apply before allocation: request-line bytes, header count, total header bytes, individual name/value bytes, chunk metadata, trailer count/bytes, URI bytes, and pipeline depth. Header, body-start, body-progress, total-request, keep-alive, and response-write timeouts protect against slow-client attacks.

## 6. HTTP/2 Protocol Correctness

HTTP/2 support includes:

- TLS ALPN `h2`; cleartext h2c is disabled on public production listeners and requires an explicit private profile.
- Valid connection preface, SETTINGS, stream states, frame sizes, pseudo-header ordering, authority, content length, and forbidden connection-specific headers.
- Bounded HPACK dynamic table, header list size, concurrent streams, pending resets, control frames, outbound queue, and per-connection/per-stream buffers.
- Bidirectional flow control tied to application and upstream consumption so a slow peer cannot force unbounded buffering.
- Priority input is bounded and may be normalized to an implementation-safe scheduling policy without starvation.
- PING, graceful GOAWAY, stream cancellation, trailers, extended `CONNECT` only for supported upgrades, and deterministic shutdown behavior.
- Defenses for rapid reset, continuation floods, empty-frame floods, oversized header compression work, stream churn, and connection-level CPU amplification.

HTTP/2 errors use the correct stream or connection scope. One malformed stream does not terminate unrelated streams unless the protocol requires a connection error. Metrics use bounded reason classifications.

## 7. Request And Response Semantics

- URI normalization, percent decoding, dot-segment handling, query preservation, route matching, filesystem mapping, and upstream URI construction are distinct phases.
- No phase decodes data twice. Encoded separators, invalid UTF-8 policy, NUL, traversal, and platform-specific separator forms are covered by negative tests.
- Request bodies are streamed with backpressure. In-memory aggregation is available only for explicitly bounded managed handlers.
- Cancellation propagates when clients disconnect, deadlines expire, routes are superseded, or shutdown reaches its cancellation phase.
- Responses validate status, header names/values, framing, content length, transfer encoding, trailers, and no-body status rules before bytes are committed.
- Standard `Date`, server identity disclosure, connection, cache, content type, content length, and security headers are controlled by versioned policy.
- Error responses are deterministic, bounded, content-negotiated where supported, and do not expose internal paths, upstream addresses, stack traces, or secrets.

## 8. Static Content Engine

Static serving supports:

- Approved filesystem roots and immutable packaged/Drive artifacts.
- Exact root/alias semantics, index resolution, `tryFiles`, SPA fallback, canonical redirects, and controlled directory listing.
- MIME and charset mapping with safe fallback, `nosniff`, configurable download disposition, and no content-type inference from untrusted query data.
- Strong or weak ETag policy, Last-Modified, RFC preconditions, `If-Range`, single and multiple byte ranges, HEAD, and correct `304`/`416` behavior.
- Precompressed gzip/Brotli asset selection using `Accept-Encoding` and `Vary`, without serving stale or mismatched sidecars.
- Efficient platform file transfer such as zero-copy/sendfile when safe and available, with a bounded asynchronous fallback.
- Bounded file descriptor and metadata caches keyed by canonical file identity with change detection and safe invalidation.

Canonicalization and authorization occur before opening the file. Symlink, hard-link where relevant, mount/reparse point, device, named pipe, alternate data stream, hidden file, dot file, case collision, TOCTOU, and replacement races use a documented fail-closed policy. Content roots are read-only to the serving process unless an explicitly separate managed write workflow owns them.

## 9. Reverse Proxy Engine

Proxying supports:

- HTTP/1.1 upstreams at P0 and HTTP/2/gRPC upstreams at P1.
- Correct upstream URI mapping, hop-by-hop header removal, Host policy, trusted proxy identity, WebSocket upgrade, SSE flushing, trailers, and cancellation.
- Full-duplex streaming where the protocol permits it, with bounded independent request and response flow control.
- Per-attempt connect, TLS handshake, response-header, read-progress, write-progress, idle, and total deadlines constrained by the request deadline.
- Bounded connection pools partitioned by origin, TLS identity, protocol, application, and policy; idle/lifetime limits prevent stale or cross-security-context reuse.
- Health-aware load balancing, target drain, maximum connections, queue bounds, circuit breaking, passive failure tracking, active checks, outlier ejection, and recovery.
- Retry and hedging only under an explicit idempotency/replay policy, attempt cap, retry budget, remaining deadline, and request-body commitment rules.

Buffering defaults are route/profile-specific. When request or response replay requires spooling, memory thresholds, individual file size, total app/process disk quota, file permissions, encryption policy, cleanup deadline, and disk-full behavior are mandatory. Temporary files use SDKWork runtime directories, random names, exclusive creation, and guaranteed bounded cleanup.

The runtime is a reverse proxy. It rejects arbitrary destination selection, open `CONNECT`, untrusted scheme/host interpolation, link-local/cloud metadata destinations, DNS rebinding, and private-address resolution unless an explicit SSRF policy authorizes the target.

Current upstream TLS boundary: HTTPS uses Rustls with system WebPKI roots by default. An upstream may replace or extend roots with bounded protected CA files, present a bounded client identity for mTLS, and constrain TLS 1.2/1.3. The target hostname remains the SNI and verification identity. Each upstream and each immutable Watch generation owns a separate client/pool, so trust or client-identity changes cannot reuse connections authenticated under the previous security context. Pinning, CRL/OCSP, dynamic secret providers, and live file-only rotation remain pending.

Current upstream resilience boundary: each immutable upstream owns non-queuing in-flight request admission and an aggregate physical-connection ceiling held through their respective streaming request and socket lifetimes. Optional unique-authority target ceilings add a second socket-lifetime boundary before DNS/TCP/TLS and include active H1, multiplexed H2, and idle sockets. HTTP/1 parsing and H2 Header Lists have explicit response Header byte limits, and one protocol-independent allocation-free decoded-field check runs before proxy forwarding. Fixed-cardinality atomic target state tracks configured `5xx`, transport, and response Header failures with finite passive ejection and supervised active checks. Business requests use bounded relative target weights inside a primary tier and enter the backup tier only when no unattempted primary is eligible; an expired primary probe takes precedence during recovery. An optional policy performs at most eight sequential attempts within one total deadline for Body-end-of-stream GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, and DELETE requests, selecting a different currently eligible target after configured `error`, `timeout`, `http_502`, `http_503`, or `http_504` outcomes. One request permit spans the sequence; every attempt independently retains DNS, TLS, physical-connection, response-Header, and health bounds. POST, PATCH, pending Body/Trailer Frames, WebSocket upgrades, and local capacity saturation remain single-attempt, and no request payload is buffered, copied, or spooled. Nginx shared-zone/cross-process connection accounting, exact smooth/slow-start/least-connection/hash selection, multi-priority discovery, non-idempotent or Body replay, shared retry budgets, hedging, full circuit breaking, and cluster-global health remain pending.

## 10. DNS And Dynamic Upstream Resolution

- DNS resolution is asynchronous and never blocks an event-loop worker.
- Positive and negative answers honor configurable TTL floors/ceilings and bounded stale-on-error behavior.
- Resolver concurrency, queries per name, answer count, CNAME depth, response bytes, cache entries, and cache bytes are bounded.
- IPv4/IPv6 selection, fallback, address rotation, and connection racing behavior are deterministic and observable.
- Address changes update new connection selection without terminating healthy in-flight requests.
- Empty, malformed, poisoned, private, loopback, multicast, link-local, or otherwise forbidden answers fail according to upstream SSRF policy.
- Service discovery is introduced only through an approved typed adapter; DNS names and control-plane target sets cannot race to create two authorities.

Resolver failure does not cause an unbounded retry storm. Each upstream declares whether a last valid answer may be used temporarily, how long, and what happens after it expires.

Current verified boundary: the foundation profile uses one bounded asynchronous system resolver per profile, shared across its upstreams. It provides finite lookup timeout, retained-answer count, non-queuing concurrent-query admission, per-upstream immutable address authorization, literal-IP validation, per-resolution rebinding checks, and finite idle pooled-connection lifetime. It does not yet implement custom DNS server transport, authoritative TTL/CNAME processing, application positive/negative cache, stale answers, resolver retries, health-aware selection, or deterministic connection racing; the target requirements above remain commercial release gates.

## 11. Compression

- Gzip and Brotli negotiation respects q-values, wildcard/identity semantics, MIME allowlists, minimum/maximum size, existing `Content-Encoding`, `Cache-Control: no-transform`, and `Vary`.
- Static precompressed content is preferred when valid. Dynamic compression uses bounded concurrency and CPU budgets and runs off latency-sensitive executor work when necessary.
- Secrets mixed with attacker-controlled reflected input are excluded from compression through policy to reduce compression side-channel risk.
- Compression buffers, encoder state, output expansion checks, and queue depth are included in memory governance.
- Unsupported encodings produce standards-correct fallback or `406` only when identity is explicitly unacceptable.

## 12. Proxy Cache

The bounded proxy cache supports:

- Canonical keys containing approved scheme, authority, normalized path/query, method, selected headers, upstream identity, and tenant/application scope.
- HTTP freshness, validators, `Age`, `Vary`, conditional revalidation, stale-while-revalidate, stale-if-error, and deterministic warning behavior where supported.
- Explicit handling of authorization, cookies, `Set-Cookie`, private/no-store/no-cache, partial content, redirects, errors, and unsafe methods.
- Collapsed forwarding and bounded per-key waiters to prevent cache stampedes.
- Memory and disk tiers with entry, object, byte, inode, write-rate, and eviction budgets.
- Authenticated purge/ban operations scoped to application and cache namespace.
- Atomic metadata/body publication so partial writes never become cache hits.

Cache poisoning, key confusion, unkeyed inputs, host confusion, range confusion, variant explosion, and cross-tenant disclosure are release-blocking security failures. V1 does not promise globally coherent cache contents across nodes; each policy declares local cache scope and invalidation expectations.

## 13. Hierarchical Resource Governor

Resource limits exist at process, application, listener, virtual host, route, upstream, and client/source scopes as applicable:

| Resource | Required controls |
| --- | --- |
| Memory | Global ceiling, emergency reserve, per-connection/stream/request estimates, cache/buffer/queue budgets, and admission threshold. |
| Connections | Accepted, active, idle, handshake, per-source, per-app, upstream, and pending accept limits. |
| File descriptors/handles | Listener, client, upstream, static file, cache, log, temp file, and reserve budgets. |
| CPU-expensive work | TLS handshakes, regex, compression, crypto, parsing, logging, config compilation, and health-check concurrency. |
| Queues | Accept, handshake, request, upstream wait, retry, log, metric export, cache fill, disk spool, and background operation bounds. |
| Disk | Cache, temporary spool, logs, snapshots, support bundles, and certificate rollback quotas. |
| Configuration | File bytes, include depth/count, apps, listeners, hosts, routes, regex, upstreams, certificates, snapshots, and activation concurrency. |

Admission control begins before the hard ceiling and preserves an emergency margin for health, readiness, diagnostics, drain, and rollback. The server returns bounded `429`, `503`, connection refusal, or protocol-appropriate resets according to policy; it must not continue allocating until the allocator or OS kills the process.

Limits cannot be bypassed by protocol upgrade, retries, internal redirects, compression, cache fills, high-cardinality observability, disconnected clients, or configuration reload. Accounting is released on every success, error, timeout, cancellation, panic boundary, and shutdown path.

## 14. Request-Path Concurrency Rules

- No blocking filesystem, DNS, database, KMS, certificate issuer, process execution, compression, or CPU-heavy regex work runs directly on an asynchronous event-loop worker.
- Shared structures use immutable snapshots, sharded/lock-free reads, or short bounded critical sections. A lock is never held across `.await`, network I/O, filesystem I/O, callback execution, or process control.
- Lock ordering and ownership are documented for mutable runtime registries. Reload, shutdown, certificate rotation, health updates, and metrics collection cannot create cyclic waits.
- Bounded channels declare capacity, producer behavior, consumer failure behavior, shutdown semantics, and what is dropped or rejected on saturation.
- Per-request tasks are cancellable and owned. Detached tasks, background retries, timers, watchers, and health checks have lifecycle supervision and bounded cardinality.
- Panics are contained at approved task/process boundaries, counted, and never converted into a successful response or activation.

## 15. Runtime Observability

Every served request can be correlated with protocol, listener, application, virtual host, route, policy, upstream attempt, response status, bytes, duration, active snapshot, and server-owned trace identity. Labels remain low-cardinality; raw host values, URIs, user IDs, certificate subjects, and arbitrary header values are not metric dimensions.

Runtime metrics include:

- Accepts, active/idle connections, HTTP/2 streams, handshakes, request phases, bytes, response classes, disconnects, timeouts, and protocol errors.
- Memory estimates and allocator/resident observations, descriptors, task counts, queue depth, cache/spool/log disk, and emergency reserve.
- Route/upstream latency, pool state, DNS freshness, health, retries, circuits, cache, compression, rate limits, and load shedding.
- Active snapshot, reload generation, retained snapshots, node convergence, and local recovery state.

Diagnostic dumps are bounded, redacted, authorized, rate-limited, and generated asynchronously. Profiling is disabled by default in public production and uses a separately protected operations surface.

## 16. Verification

Required suites include:

- HTTP/1.0/1.1 parser and semantic conformance, differential parsing, fuzzing, request smuggling, slowloris, malformed chunking, pipeline, disconnect, and timeout tests.
- HTTP/2 conformance, HPACK, flow control, rapid reset, frame flood, stream churn, GOAWAY, trailers, and graceful shutdown tests.
- Static precondition/range/path/security tests on Linux, Windows, and macOS tooling, plus supported Linux production filesystems.
- Proxy streaming, half-close, WebSocket, SSE, gRPC, retry, cancellation, pool isolation, DNS rebinding, upstream TLS, and failure tests.
- Cache RFC behavior, poisoning, variant explosion, stampede, purge authorization, disk-full, crash recovery, and eviction tests.
- Hierarchical memory/connection/descriptor/queue/disk limits, adversarial overload, OOM prevention, executor starvation, deadlock, cancellation leak, and 24-hour soak tests.
- Differential Nginx fixtures for the declared compatibility profile and protocol interoperability with supported clients and upstream servers.

Fuzz and property-test corpora are retained as regression evidence. Failures must reproduce with the exact runtime version, snapshot checksum, seed, platform, and resource profile.

## 17. Acceptance Criteria

- The packaged Rust runtime serves HTTP and HTTPS without an external Nginx process and without synchronous control-plane/database access on the request path.
- HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 conformance and adversarial parser suites pass with no known request-smuggling ambiguity.
- Static, proxy, WebSocket, SSE, DNS, TLS, routing, compression, and cache behavior meets its declared profile.
- Every allocation-amplifying input has a pre-allocation limit, bounded queue, timeout, cancellation path, and saturation behavior.
- Process health and the last verified application traffic remain available during temporary control-plane, database, certificate issuer, and DNS control API outages.
- OOM, descriptor exhaustion, disk-full, slow-client, retry storm, reload storm, and cache stampede tests degrade predictably without losing the operations reserve.
- No request-path lock is held across asynchronous or external I/O, and concurrency/deadlock test evidence covers reload, shutdown, health, certificate rotation, and upstream churn.
- Performance, memory, compatibility, and availability targets in the parent PRD pass on the published reference profiles.

## 18. Current Verified Delivery Boundary

[REQ-2026-0007](../requirements/REQ-2026-0007-bounded-http-protocol-ingress.md) delivers a bounded protocol-ingress slice. HTTP/1 now has explicit parser-buffer bytes, header-count, and complete-header deadline controls. HTTP/2 now has explicit concurrent-stream, header-list, pending-reset, local-error-reset, per-stream send-buffer, flow-control-window, and frame-size controls. Cross-field validation caps configured concurrent header-list and send-buffer products at 64 MiB per connection.

[REQ-2026-0008](../requirements/REQ-2026-0008-safe-http1-chunked-framing.md) replaces the temporary no-Transfer-Encoding policy with an incremental Framing Guard after TLS decryption and before Hyper normalization. The Guard validates every Keep-Alive/Pipeline request, accepts exactly Chunked transfer coding, bounds Chunk Size/Extension, Body totals, Trailer count/bytes, and rejects TE/CL in either order plus all duplicate Content-Length values. HTTP/2 selected by ALPN bypasses the HTTP/1 Guard.

REQ-2026-0008 also established all-action Body accounting: fixed-length Body limits return `413` before every action, non-proxy actions stream-discard and count Body Data, Chunked totals are checked before routing can report success, and HTTP/2 bodies without Content-Length are bounded. Reverse proxying removes inbound framing headers and lets the upstream HTTP client generate new framing; REQ-2026-0028 preserves this behavior after the Hyper transport migration.

[REQ-2026-0009](../requirements/REQ-2026-0009-bounded-proxy-trailer-fidelity.md) replaces the data-only proxy bridge with frame-preserving request and response bodies. Valid declared HTTP/1 Trailers and HTTP/2 trailing HEADERS cross the proxy without Body collection. `maxTrailerBytes` and `maxTrailers` now cover request and upstream declarations plus actual request and response Trailer frames. Hop-specific `TE` is removed from the client request and regenerated as `TE: trailers` toward the upstream; unsupported client TE tokens fail closed. HTTP/1 recipients still advertise `TE: trailers`, and HTTP/1 Trailer fields must be declared before the body because the runtime will not buffer an entire stream to synthesize a late declaration.

[REQ-2026-0010](../requirements/REQ-2026-0010-http1-connection-semantics.md) adds strict HTTP/1.1 Expect/Continue handling, early `413` without an informational response, upstream Expect termination, HTTP/1.0 default-host/Keep-Alive/Pipeline behavior, HTTP/1.0 Transfer-Encoding rejection, and complete/truncated TCP half-close tests. The same Continue sequence is proven after TLS/ALPN. A real Nginx 1.26.2 probe records semantic matches, intentional fail-closed differences, and Hyper's HTTP/1.0 response-version constraint.

[REQ-2026-0011](../requirements/REQ-2026-0011-bounded-http1-request-fields.md) adds pre-Hyper request-line, method, request-target, and individual Header/Trailer name/value budgets. The original-wire parser validates request-line structure, method tokens, visible-ASCII targets, field tokens/control bytes, and applies the smaller of total and individual line budgets before growing its line buffer. The new fields are schema-validated and Restart-only under Watch reload.

[REQ-2026-0012](../requirements/REQ-2026-0012-bounded-http2-abuse-and-drain.md) adds a constant-memory decrypted HTTP/2 Wire Guard before Hyper. It bounds fixed-window Frame, new Stream, and `RST_STREAM` churn plus encoded `HEADERS`/`CONTINUATION` bytes and fragment count. Hyper/H2 still owns protocol parsing, HPACK, flow control, SETTINGS, stream errors, and GOAWAY. Real TLS/H2 evidence covers advertised settings, isolated Frame/new-Stream/reset abuse, encoded Header Block rejection, `ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM` for excessive H2 local-error resets, healthy-connection recovery, and graceful GOAWAY drain. HPACK dynamic-table sizing is deliberately not exposed because the selected Hyper server builder has no real configuration path.

[REQ-2026-0013](../requirements/REQ-2026-0013-process-request-admission.md) adds one process-wide, non-queuing `maxConcurrentRequests` gate shared across listeners. Saturation produces bounded `503` responses, and admitted permits move into a zero-copy response Body wrapper so streaming proxy/static work remains counted after Handler completion. Real HTTP/1 and TLS/H2 tests cover overload headers, Stream isolation, completion recovery, and H2 reset cancellation. Aggregate Core validation caps active H2 Header List/send-buffer and connection encoded-header products.

[REQ-2026-0014](../requirements/REQ-2026-0014-response-progress-timeouts.md) separates response producer-idle from downstream write-stall control. The admitted response Body timer resets only on meaningful Frames and releases capacity on timeout; the accepted-stream timer bounds continuously Pending write, flush, and shutdown after TLS and framing guards. Real HTTP/1, slow-reader, and TLS/H2 tests prove timeout scope and recovery before the longer upstream deadline.

[REQ-2026-0015](../requirements/REQ-2026-0015-request-body-progress-timeouts.md) adds distinct first-meaningful-request-Frame and later Body progress deadlines before every resource action. The zero-copy wrapper stores no request content, empty Data cannot reset either phase, and timeout classification survives the proxy adapter. Real HTTP/1 and TLS/H2 tests prove `408`, HTTP/1 close, H2 Stream isolation, one-permit recovery, and same-connection H2 reuse.

[REQ-2026-0016](../requirements/REQ-2026-0016-http1-keep-alive-idle-timeout.md) adds a protocol-scoped HTTP/1 request-between-request idle deadline. Connection Stream and per-connection Service state coordinate active response Body ownership and pending write flushes so uploads, streaming responses, and ordered pipelines cannot be misclassified as idle. H2 on a mixed ALPN listener bypasses the field.

[REQ-2026-0017](../requirements/REQ-2026-0017-bounded-uri-query-components.md) adds allocation-free cross-H1/H2 raw and once-decoded Path, segment, Query, parameter, and component budgets before route selection. Invalid percent/control/backslash representation fails with `400`; budget overflow uses `414`; valid Query forwarding remains byte-preserving.

[REQ-2026-0018](../requirements/REQ-2026-0018-canonical-uri-normalization.md) implements one bounded canonical Path alongside the preserved raw Path and Query. Canonical identity now drives route selection, static mapping, and `stripPrefix` proxy rewrites; no-rewrite proxying preserves the raw URI. Its ADR remains proposed because accepting decoded-backslash and invalid-UTF8 hardening differences is a human compatibility and security decision.

[REQ-2026-0019](../requirements/REQ-2026-0019-bounded-http1-pipeline-depth.md) adds a connection-local bound on complete HTTP/1 request heads read by the original-wire Guard but not yet submitted to Hyper's Service. A synchronous dispatch decrement adds no request queue or Body buffer; over-depth connections close and H2 bypasses the policy.

[REQ-2026-0020](../requirements/REQ-2026-0020-http2-keep-alive-ping-timeout.md) configures Hyper/H2 to send PING after finite inbound-Frame inactivity, wait a finite ACK deadline, and emit `GOAWAY(NO_ERROR)` before closing an unresponsive connection. Responsive idle clients remain connected, so this does not replace a future healthy-idle or maximum-connection-age policy.

[REQ-2026-0021](../requirements/REQ-2026-0021-proxy-early-response-request-lifecycle.md) adds explicit two-phase ownership for streamed proxy uploads. Final upstream headers pause client Body polling; complete response handoff or downstream cancellation then terminates the upstream producer. HTTP/1 closes both non-reusable half-written connections, while H2 sends `RST_STREAM(NO_ERROR)` and preserves other Streams. Plain/TLS/H2 and pinned Nginx evidence prove status, Body, timeout, admission, and pool behavior without request buffering.

[REQ-2026-0022](../requirements/REQ-2026-0022-bounded-connection-maximum-age.md) adds one finite maximum lifetime to every accepted HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connection. The runtime owns and supervises each Hyper connection Future, performs protocol-aware graceful retirement at age expiry, bounds in-flight completion by the existing drain deadline, and joins or cancels every connection task. Real HTTP/1 and TLS/H2 tests cover reuse prevention, `GOAWAY(NO_ERROR)`, in-flight completion, forced drain, fresh-connection recovery, and Restart-only Watch behavior.

[REQ-2026-0023](../requirements/REQ-2026-0023-bounded-upstream-dns-ssrf-policy.md) adds a bounded system-resolver adapter, originally through Reqwest's public resolver port and retained by REQ-2026-0028 behind the custom Hyper connector. Resolver concurrency has no waiter queue, answer retention uses one overflow detection item, and every literal or resolved address passes a fail-closed policy before connection. Real localhost proxy evidence proves default loopback denial and explicit dual-stack authorization; injected rebinding evidence proves a public answer cannot later change to private without rejection.

[REQ-2026-0024](../requirements/REQ-2026-0024-upstream-tls-identity-pool-isolation.md) adds system/custom/combined upstream trust, bounded protected CA and client-identity files, mTLS, TLS 1.2/1.3 constraints, and per-upstream/per-generation pool isolation. Real private-CA, hostname mismatch, mTLS-required, incompatible-version, invalid-material, root-count, and Watch replacement tests prove fail-closed behavior.

[REQ-2026-0025](../requirements/REQ-2026-0025-bounded-upstream-admission-passive-health.md) adds non-queuing per-upstream request-lifecycle admission and fixed-cardinality passive target health. Real streaming saturation/recovery, unhealthy-alternative skip, ejection, half-open recovery, all-unavailable local rejection, no-hidden-retry, and fresh Watch-generation tests prove the boundary.

[REQ-2026-0026](../requirements/REQ-2026-0026-supervised-active-upstream-health.md) adds optional bounded HTTP active checks with one supervised scheduler task per generation, a process-wide concurrent-future ceiling, fixed target schedule/state, status/timeout/Body bounds, independent active/passive selection, and explicit reload/shutdown cancellation plus join. Real wrong-status, timeout, streamed-oversize, recovery-threshold, concurrency, Watch-replacement, and shutdown tests prove the local lifecycle.

[REQ-2026-0027](../requirements/REQ-2026-0027-adaptive-resource-pressure-admission.md) adds optional supervised Windows Working Set/HANDLE, Linux RSS/FD/finite-cgroup-v2, and event-loop-lag sampling. Absolute reserves, strict effective hysteresis, total/business request partitioning, pre-task socket shedding, exact fixed health reserve, HTTPS/H2 Stream isolation, Watch restart classification, recovery, and shutdown join are covered by real resource-exhaustion evidence.

[REQ-2026-0028](../requirements/REQ-2026-0028-bounded-upstream-physical-connections.md) replaces the upstream transport with a bounded Hyper/Rustls connector whose non-queuing permit lives for the complete TCP/TLS/HTTP/1/H2/idle socket lifetime. Real HTTP/1 tests prove immediate saturation, no hidden connection or health mutation, reuse, idle retention/expiry, recovery, Watch pool replacement, and shutdown closure. Real HTTPS/H2 tests prove concurrent Streams reuse one physical connection under a hard limit of one. Listener startup no longer pins the first runtime generation, so retired pools and their descriptors are reclaimable.

[REQ-2026-0029](../requirements/REQ-2026-0029-bounded-upstream-response-headers.md) adds per-upstream HTTP/1 parser, H2 Header List, and protocol-independent decoded Header budgets. Unit tests prove exact accounting, repeated field occurrences, and arithmetic-overflow classification. Real HTTP/1 tests prove count/byte rejection, generic `502`, no Header/Body disclosure, passive ejection, and recovery; HTTPS/H2 tests prove post-decode count rejection, Header List rejection, and subsequent request recovery; active-health and Watch tests prove failed observations, new-client publication, and invalid-candidate retention.

[REQ-2026-0030](../requirements/REQ-2026-0030-weighted-upstream-selection.md) makes the existing target `weight` contract executable. Unit tests prove exact `3:1` slot cycles and equal-weight round robin. Real dual-origin traffic proves relative distribution, configured failure ejection, healthy-only routing, one-request half-open recovery, atomic Watch weight replacement, and invalid-candidate retention without a weight-expanded schedule.

[REQ-2026-0031](../requirements/REQ-2026-0031-bounded-websocket-reverse-proxy.md) adds classic HTTP/1.1 WebSocket reverse proxying on HTTP and verified-TLS WSS listeners. The HTTP/1 wire guard switches to raw bytes only after strict GET/version/Connection/Upgrade/no-Body-framing validation; every failed or rejected upgrade then forces downstream close. A runtime-owned supervisor retains both Hyper upgraded sockets, upstream request and physical-connection admission, and the immutable Watch generation. Each tunnel uses fixed 16 KiB directional buffers, the existing `maxConnectionAgeMs` hard lifetime, runtime shutdown cancellation, and only the listener drain budget that remains. Real tests prove client and upstream read-ahead, 70,000-byte bidirectional traffic, half-close, invalid-101 non-disclosure, normal 403 forwarding, admission/physical saturation and recovery, mixed HTTPS ALPN, old-generation continuity, hard lifetime, and shutdown.

[REQ-2026-0032](../requirements/REQ-2026-0032-bounded-management-http-metrics.md) fixes the management HTTP observability composition. One bounded framework registry is now shared by app-api, backend-api, and `/metrics`, so protected success and rejection traffic is no longer reported as zero. Unresolved routes use one `unmatched` series; request series, pipeline-stage series, key bytes, and stage-label bytes have hard framework ceilings with dropped-series counters. Startup dimensions accept only canonical SDKWork environment, deployment profile, runtime target, and database profile labels.

[REQ-2026-0033](../requirements/REQ-2026-0033-bounded-data-plane-operations-metrics.md) adds a runtime-owned fixed-cardinality metric registry and an opt-in loopback host operations listener. Saturating atomics cover downstream connection/request lifetimes and admission rejection, upstream attempts/results/rejections, reload outcomes, and WebSocket tunnel lifecycle. Scrapes aggregate current target-health and resource-pressure atomics into fixed state vocabularies without retaining a label map or exposing application domains, paths, listener/upstream ids, addresses, revisions, tenant/user identity, or request/trace identity. The operations listener is HTTP/1-only and has fixed connection, Header, deadline, lifetime, and drain bounds; application virtual hosts never inherit its routes.

[REQ-2026-0034](../requirements/REQ-2026-0034-bounded-data-plane-red-capacity-metrics.md) completes the bounded node-local RED and capacity slice. Fixed-bucket histograms measure full response-stream request duration by status class and upstream response-Header duration by terminal result. Streaming request/response Body and successful WebSocket tunnel lengths feed saturating byte counters; seven fixed protocol/error categories and eight fixed DNS results avoid request-derived labels. Current-generation request and physical-connection Semaphores expose aggregate configured/in-use/available capacity. Cancellation leases close active DNS/request gauges and result accounting without queues or retained observations. Hyper idle-pool occupancy and partial WebSocket byte totals after copy error are not invented.

[REQ-2026-0035](../requirements/REQ-2026-0035-bounded-safe-upstream-retries.md) adds an opt-in bounded sequential retry state machine using exact supported Nginx `proxy_next_upstream` condition tokens. A fixed 1,024-bit stack bitmap prevents target reuse across the schema maximum of 1,000 targets, and each actually started retry increments one fixed-reason saturating counter. Real dual-origin tests prove status and transport failover, omitted-policy single-attempt behavior, unsafe-method/Body refusal, total-deadline enforcement, final retryable-response Body forwarding, and cancellation-safe half-open probe release. This profile deliberately provides no `non_idempotent` token, Body collection, disk spool, parallel attempt, or cluster-shared state.

[REQ-2026-0036](../requirements/REQ-2026-0036-bounded-target-physical-connections.md) adds optional target-authority physical connection limits beneath the existing aggregate upstream limit. Both non-queuing permits live in the actual socket wrapper, so pooled H1/H2 and idle lifetime are counted without request/Stream approximation. Real single- and dual-origin tests prove early target saturation while aggregate capacity remains, independent target capacity, recovery, H2 multiplexing on one permit, Watch/shutdown ownership, and fixed aggregate metrics without target labels.

[REQ-2026-0037](../requirements/REQ-2026-0037-bounded-backup-upstream-targets.md) adds immutable primary/backup target roles. Bounded selection and retry scans ignore backups while an unattempted primary is eligible, then apply the same weight, health, probe, TLS, and capacity rules within the backup tier. Unit and real dual-origin tests prove zero routine backup traffic, passive failover, primary half-open precedence/recovery, primary-to-backup retry, Watch role replacement, and invalid-candidate retention without tier collections or new target labels.

These slices do not satisfy this PRD's final acceptance. Hard allocator/OOM immunity, CPU/PSI/disk pressure, per-tenant fairness, custom/authoritative DNS with bounded TTL/cache/stale/CNAME behavior, upstream pinning/revocation/dynamic secrets, Nginx shared-zone/cross-process/cluster connection accounting, accept/TLS/cache phase telemetry, authoritative Hyper idle-pool telemetry, tracing and bounded exporters, authenticated remote operations, dashboards/alerts, cluster-global health, exact smooth/slow-start/least-connection/hash balancing, non-idempotent/idempotency-key or Body replay, shared retry budgets, hedging and cluster circuit state, RFC 8441 extended CONNECT, WebSocket frame/heartbeat/idle policy, undeclared cross-protocol Trailer synthesis, full gRPC Trailer/deadline/status conformance, complete HTTP/1 differential and fuzz corpora, exhaustive HTTP/2 malformed-frame/HPACK CPU/fuzz and Nginx differential suites, and published 100,000-connection/24-hour load-soak memory evidence remain blockers. Canonical URI semantics also remain unaccepted until ADR-20260716 receives human review.
